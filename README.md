## Overview
Creating a Garage Band with Object Oriented Programming.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements
Use Python classes to model a **Band** made up of different kinds of musicians.

Start with **Guitarist**,**Bassist**, and **Drummer**.

Make use of a **Musician** base class to handle common functionality which particular kinds of musicians will inherit.

### User Acceptance Tests

**Band Tests**

- A **Band** instance should have a **name** attribute which is a string.
- A **Band** instance should have a **members** attribute which is a list of instances that inherit from **Musician** base (or super) class.
- A **Band** instance should have a **play_solos** method that asks each member musician to play a solo, in the order they were added to band.
- A **Band** instance should have appropriate **`__str__`** and **`__repr__`** methods.
- A **Band** should have a class method to_list which returns a list of previously created Band instances

**Musician Subclass Tests**

- Each kind of **Musician** instance should have appropriate **`__str__`** and **`__repr__`** methods.
- Each kind of **Musician** instance should have a **get_instrument** method that returns string.
- Each kind of **Musician** instance should have a **play_solo** method that returns string.

**Stretch**

- A **Band** should have a static method **create_from_data** which takes a collection of formatted data and returns a created **Band** instance.
    - The **Band** instance should have its members be set to musicians based on info from the input.
    - The formatted data should be in a file
    - The exact formatting is up to you.
